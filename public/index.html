      content="Inca Wheels is an indigenous owned outdoor receational vehicle rental
      company based in the Pacific Northwest. Started as a way to help raise
      funds for the nonprofit Ruta Verde that focuses on Sustainable Development projects including the
      building of Community Forests in North America and creating
      sustainable food solutions in Peru. The Inca were honorable people
      that valued their surrounding environments at the core of their belief
      systems, and we hope to honor this ideology by creating a business
      that focuses on caring for the planet, not just profits."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
